# FusionprimitivityofMultiplicity-freesubgroupsofS_-n-
GAP code that checks possible multiplicity-free subgroups of S_{n} for nontrivial fusions.
This code is executed on GAP (version 4.11).
On GAP prompt (gap>) execute each line of code sequentially.
The code also displays the expected output after execution.

## Theoretical background
The code also checks three infinite families of subgroups for a few cases namely:
1) The Johnson scheme.
2) The folded Johnson scheme.
3) The perfect matching scheme.
